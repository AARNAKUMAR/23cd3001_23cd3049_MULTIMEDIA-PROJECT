Day 1: The Dawn of Communication
* World's Oldest Stories: The oldest known cave paintings, like those found in Indonesia, are over 44,000 years old, depicting hunting scenes and mythical beings.
* The 30-Meter Scroll: A single, complete papyrus scroll, such as one containing a work like The Odyssey, could be up to 100 feet (30 meters) long, requiring two hands to unroll.
* Cuneiform's Complexity: The Mesopotamian Cuneiform script, one of the earliest forms of writing, contained over 1,000 distinct characters and was used for more than 3,000 years.

Day 2: The Rise of Alphabets & Early Books
* The Mother of All Alphabets: The Phoenician alphabet, developed around 1200 BCE, had only 22 letters, all of them consonants. It is the ancestor of almost all modern alphabets, including Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.
* The Book's First Big Win: The codex (the modern book format) largely replaced the scroll because it was perfect for early Christians who needed to quickly flip between different passages of the Bible for study and reference.
* Beech Tree Books: The English word "book" comes from the Old Germanic word "b?k", which means "beech tree," because early Germanic peoples would carve runes onto beech wood tablets.

Day 3: Writing in the Classical & Medieval World
* A Bible's Weight in Sheep: Crafting a single, hand-written medieval Bible required a flock's worth of material—the prepared skins (vellum) of over 200 sheep or calves.
* The Unbreakable Word: Roman inscriptions carved into monuments used V-shaped cuts that created a play of light and shadow, making them legible from a distance and asserting the permanence of the Roman Empire's laws and victories.
* Not a Tapestry: The famous Bayeux Tapestry, which chronicles the Norman Conquest of 1066, is technically not a tapestry at all. It is a massive, 230-foot-long embroidery.

Day 4: The Print Revolution
* From 40 to 3,600: A highly skilled medieval monk could, at best, copy about 40 pages of a manuscript by hand per day. Johannes Gutenberg's printing press could produce 3,600 pages in the same amount of time.
* Explosion of Knowledge: Just 50 years after the invention of the printing press in 1450, over 20 million books had been printed and circulated throughout Europe, a number far greater than all the manuscripts produced in the previous millennium.
* No Headlines, Just News: The earliest newspapers of the 17th century did not have headlines. They simply began with a date and the city of origin (e.g., "Venice, July 25"), presenting news as a straightforward letter from a distant place.

Day 5: Mass Media in the Industrial Age
* Shrinking the World: The first official telegraph message, sent by Samuel Morse in 1844, was "What hath God wrought." By the 1870s, a transatlantic cable could send a message from London to New York in under 10 minutes.
* The Power of Steam: The steam-powered rotary press, invented in 1843, was the engine behind the "Penny Press." It could print on both sides of a continuous roll of paper, producing over 8,000 sheets per hour.
* News for a Cent: The "Penny Press" newspapers of the 1830s were the first to be funded primarily by advertising rather than expensive subscriptions, making news accessible to the working class for the first time.

Day 6: The Dawn of Electronic & Personal Media
* The First Recorded Words: The first sound ever captured and played back was Thomas Edison reciting the first line of "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on his phonograph in 1877.
* Designed to Be Slow: The QWERTY keyboard layout, patented in 1874 for mechanical typewriters, was intentionally designed to slow typists down. Placing common letter pairs far apart prevented the machine's keys from jamming.
* An Urgent First Call: The first telephone call was made by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant on March 10, 1876. The practical and unceremonious first words were: "Mr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you."

Day 7: The Broadcast Era
* The Panic Broadcast: The 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds," directed by Orson Welles, was performed as a series of realistic news bulletins. It was so convincing that it caused a nationwide panic, with thousands believing a real Martian invasion was happening.
* The Birth of the Blockbuster: The movie industry term "blockbuster" originated from World War II-era bombs that were powerful enough to destroy an entire city block. It was later used to describe films so popular that the lines of moviegoers would stretch around the block.
* The First TV Star Was a Cat: The very first image transmitted on television was a cartoon character: Felix the Cat. In 1928, RCA used a small Felix the Cat statue to conduct their experimental broadcasts.

Day 8: Media, War, and Persuasion
* The TV Takeover: In 1950, only 9% of American homes had a television set. Just five years later, in 1955, the number had skyrocketed to 64%. By 1960, it was nearly 90%.
* The Great Debate: The 1960 Kennedy-Nixon debate was a turning point for media. Radio listeners, focusing only on the arguments, largely believed the more experienced Nixon had won. But the far larger television audience saw a calm, confident Kennedy and a pale, sweating Nixon, and declared Kennedy the winner.
* "Jingle" All the Way: The first-ever singing radio commercial aired on Christmas Eve, 1926, for a cereal brand named Wheaties. The catchy "jingle" was so successful it is credited with saving the brand from being discontinued.

Day 9: The Technicolor Age
* The Color Boom: It took over a decade for color television to catch on. In 1964, only 3% of American households had a color set. By 1972, that number had jumped to 50%, officially marking the end of the black-and-white era.
* A "Wonderful World" in Color: One of the main drivers of color TV sales was NBC's "Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color," which showcased vibrant nature documentaries and cartoons that looked dull in black-and-white.
* Selling an Image: The rise of glossy, full-color magazines like Life and Ebony in the mid-20th century created the golden age of photojournalism, using powerful images, not just text, to tell stories and shape culture.

Day 10: The Digital Dawn
* The @ Revolution: The "@" symbol was chosen by computer programmer Ray Tomlinson in 1971 for use in email to separate a user's name from their destination server. He chose it because it was an uncommon letter that wouldn't appear in anyone's name.
* So Popular It Broke: The first commercial arcade video game, Pong, was tested in a California tavern. On its first night, it stopped working. The reason? The coin mechanism was so jammed full of quarters that it couldn't accept any more.
* The Web's First Picture: The very first photo uploaded to the World Wide Web was a picture of "Les Horribles Cernettes," a comedy band made up of employees at CERN, the laboratory where the web was invented.

Day 11: The Rise of Web 2.0
* An Elephant at the Zoo: The first video ever uploaded to YouTube (April 23, 2005) was an 18-second clip called "Me at the zoo," featuring co-founder Jawed Karim standing in front of an elephant enclosure.
* The "Awesome" Button: Facebook's iconic "Like" button was originally developed under the name "Awesome." The engineering team debated for months before settling on the simpler, more universal "Like."
* Wikipedia vs. Britannica: In a 2005 study by the journal Nature, the accuracy of science articles on Wikipedia was found to be remarkably close to that of the Encyclopædia Britannica, with an average of 4 errors per article for Wikipedia versus 3 for Britannica.

Day 12: The Mobile & App Revolution
* A Simple Christmas Greeting: The world's first SMS (Short Message Service) text message was sent on December 3, 1992, from an engineer's computer to a director's mobile phone. It read, simply: "Merry Christmas."
* Picture Characters: The word emoji is Japanese, from the words e ("picture") + moji ("character"). The original set of 176 emojis was created in 1999 for a Japanese mobile phone company and is now part of the permanent collection at New York's Museum of Modern Art.
* The App Explosion: When the Apple App Store launched in 2008, it had just 500 apps. Today, there are millions of apps available, and over 200 billion apps are downloaded annually worldwide.

Day 13: Immersive & On-Demand Media
* Theater for Your Mind: The term "podcast" was coined by a journalist in 2004 by blending the words "iPod" and "broadcast." Today, there are over 3 million active podcasts, with episodes available in more than 100 languages.
* A Sword Hanging Over Your Head: The first-ever VR and AR headset, called "The Sword of Damocles," was created in 1968. It was so enormous and heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling by a mechanical arm.
* Catching Them All: The augmented reality game Pokémon Go was downloaded over 500 million times in its first two months in 2016 and was played so much that it caused a measurable increase in physical activity and, unfortunately, a spike in traffic accidents.

Day 14: The Future of Media (2050)
* The Data Deluge: In 2025, the total amount of data created, captured, and replicated worldwide is projected to be 181 zettabytes. To store that on Blu-ray discs, your stack of discs would reach the moon 23 times.
* AI's Creative Burst: A modern AI image generator can create a completely novel, high-resolution image from a simple text description in under 60 seconds—a task that would take a human artist hours or days.
* Thinking at the Speed of Light: Experimental Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are moving beyond simple motor commands. Researchers have developed systems that can decode thoughts into speech at a rate of over 60 words per minute, approaching the speed of natural conversation.
