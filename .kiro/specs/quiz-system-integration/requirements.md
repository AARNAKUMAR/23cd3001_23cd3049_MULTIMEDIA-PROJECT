# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MediaOdyssey Quiz System Integration enhances the existing interactive timeline experience by adding comprehensive quiz functionality for each of the 14 media evolution levels. This system integrates with the custom badge images (badge-1.png through badge-14.png) located in the public/badges folder and leverages the rich educational content from FACT_CHECKS.txt and summary_for_previews_daywise.txt to create engaging, educational quiz challenges that reward users with thematic badges upon successful completion.

The quiz system builds upon the existing React + Vite + Tailwind + GSAP + Zustand architecture, adding new quiz components, question data structures, and badge reward mechanics while maintaining the established futuristic design aesthetic and smooth user experience.
