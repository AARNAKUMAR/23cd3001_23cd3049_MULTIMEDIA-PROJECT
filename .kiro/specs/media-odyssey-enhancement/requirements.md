# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MediaOdyssey project "Echoes from Tomorrow: A Media Odyssey" is an interactive web experience that visualizes the evolution of media through a Candy-Crush-style timeline with 14 sequential levels. The project currently has a solid foundation built with React + Vite + Tailwind + GSAP + Zustand + React Router, but requires significant visual and functional enhancements to match the provided UI mockups and create a more immersive, polished experience.

The enhancement focuses on refining the visual design, improving animations, expanding functionality, and ensuring the experience closely matches the futuristic, gamified aesthetic shown in the UI mockups while maintaining the existing modular architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Visual Design System

**User Story:** As a user exploring the media timeline, I want a visually stunning and cohesive futuristic interface that matches the provided UI mockups, so that I feel immersed in a high-quality, professional interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the color palette SHALL match the design guidelines with deep space navy to teal to purple to golden amber gradients
2. WHEN viewing any page THEN the typography SHALL use Orbitron for headings and Inter/Outfit for body text with proper font weights and spacing
3. WHEN interacting with level nodes THEN they SHALL display as polished glowing orbs with cyan cores and golden outlines instead of basic circles
4. WHEN viewing connecting paths THEN they SHALL appear as animated golden SVG paths with glow effects and smooth draw-on animations
5. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL show appropriate glow effects, scale transforms, and smooth transitions

### Requirement 2: Advanced Level Map Interactions

**User Story:** As a user progressing through the timeline, I want smooth, engaging animations and clear visual feedback for my progress, so that completing levels feels rewarding and the journey feels dynamic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level is completed THEN the next level SHALL unlock with an animated golden path drawing from the completed node to the next node
2. WHEN Arin (the avatar) moves between levels THEN there SHALL be a smooth GSAP-animated movement along the connecting path with particle effects
3. WHEN hovering over unlocked nodes THEN they SHALL show ripple effects and scale animations with cyan glow intensification
4. WHEN a level is locked THEN it SHALL display with grayscale filter, reduced opacity, and a lock icon overlay
5. WHEN a level is completed THEN it SHALL show an emerald glow with a checkmark indicator and completion animation

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Level Modal Experience

**User Story:** As a user exploring individual levels, I want an immersive modal experience with rich content and smooth interactions, so that I can deeply engage with each era's story and complete levels with satisfaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a level modal THEN it SHALL animate in with scale-up and opacity fade-in effects using Framer Motion
2. WHEN viewing level content THEN the modal SHALL display the era title, description, video placeholder, and expandable sections in a frosted-glass design
3. WHEN clicking "View More" THEN the quiz section SHALL expand smoothly with height and opacity animations
4. WHEN completing a level THEN the "Complete Level" button SHALL trigger unlock animations and update progress with visual feedback
5. WHEN closing the modal THEN it SHALL animate out with scale-down and fade-out effects

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Progress and Achievement System

**User Story:** As a user progressing through the timeline, I want to see my achievements and progress clearly visualized with engaging animations, so that I feel motivated to continue and can track my accomplishments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the progress bar THEN it SHALL show a golden glow trail filling left to right with smooth GSAP animations
2. WHEN earning a badge THEN it SHALL unlock with an animated reveal effect and glow enhancement
3. WHEN viewing the badges page THEN earned badges SHALL display with full color and glow effects while locked badges show grayscale with reduced opacity
4. WHEN progress updates THEN the percentage SHALL animate smoothly and persist using Zustand + localStorage
5. WHEN badges are earned THEN they SHALL be automatically unlocked based on completed levels with visual feedback

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user accessing the experience on different devices, I want the interface to work beautifully on mobile, tablet, and desktop while being accessible to all users, so that everyone can enjoy the media odyssey regardless of their device or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the level map SHALL display as a vertical linear path with condensed spacing
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the level map SHALL show the full zigzag branching pattern with optimal spacing
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL have clear focus states with cyan ring indicators
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN all progress percentages and achievement counts SHALL have proper ARIA labels
5. WHEN viewing content THEN color combinations SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios for accessibility

### Requirement 6: Performance and State Management

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the application, I want fast loading times and smooth animations without performance issues, so that the experience feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN videos and media assets SHALL be lazy-loaded to improve initial performance
2. WHEN animations are running THEN they SHALL use optimized GSAP timelines and memoized states to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN progress is made THEN state changes SHALL persist automatically using Zustand persistence middleware
4. WHEN the page reloads THEN previous progress SHALL be restored with soft resume animations
5. WHEN multiple animations run simultaneously THEN they SHALL be coordinated to prevent performance degradation

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Navigation and Routing

**User Story:** As a user navigating between different sections of the application, I want smooth page transitions and intuitive navigation, so that moving between the landing page, map, and progress feels seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between routes THEN there SHALL be smooth GSAP or Framer Motion transitions (fade, slide, or parallax style)
2. WHEN on any page THEN navigation to other sections SHALL be clearly available and accessible
3. WHEN returning to previously visited pages THEN the state SHALL be preserved and animations SHALL resume appropriately
4. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN navigation SHALL work correctly with proper state management
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN navigation SHALL be optimized for touch interactions with appropriate button sizes
